The script `file_handling_assignment.py` performs file operations in the following steps:

1. **`create_file()`**: Creates "my_file.txt" and writes three lines of text to it, with error handling for permission issues or other exceptions.
2. **`read_file()`**: Reads and displays the content of "my_file.txt", handling cases where the file might not exist.
3. **`append_to_file()`**: Appends three more lines of text to "my_file.txt", with similar error handling.
4. **`main()`**: Calls the above functions in sequence to create, read, append, and then read the file contents again.
